<summary><small>How do I go back to the previous version of the client ?</small></summary><p>

  If you have problems with the patch after upgrading the client version, then use this [tool](https://github.com/amd64fox/Rollback-Spotify) to revert back to the working    version.

<summary><small>Outdated versions of PowerShell</small></summary><p>

If you are using Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, there may be errors in the installation process due to an outdated version of NET Framework and PowerShell. 
   Do the following:
   * Upgrade to [NET Framework 4.8](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2088631)
   * Upgrade to [WMF 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616)
   * Reboot your PC
   
   <strong>Note:</strong> For Windows 8 it is not possible to upgrade the PowerShell version, please upgrade to Windows 8.1 or 10

<h1>Additional Notes:</h1>

* The repository is based on <a href="https://github.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot">BlockTheSpot</a>, and also some tricks were taken from <a href="https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli">spicetify-cli</a>, many thanks to the contributors
* SpotX will only work correctly on the latest versions of Spotify, please make sure of this before asking a question.  
* The modifiable files are replaced by the Spotify installer every time it is updated, so you will need to apply the patch again when this happens.
* SpotX will be installed even if you are using Spicetify, but you may need to run Install.bat again after running the `spicetify apply` or other commands.
