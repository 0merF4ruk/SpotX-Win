<h1>Possible problems:</h1>



<h3>Outdated versions of PowerShell</h3>
   
  If you are using Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, there may be errors in the installation process due to an outdated version of NET Framework and PowerShell. 
   Do the following:
   * Upgrade to [NET Framework 4.8](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2088631)
   * Upgrade to [WMF 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616)
   * Reboot your PC
   
   <strong>Note:</strong> For Windows 8 it is not possible to upgrade the PowerShell version, please upgrade to Windows 8.1 or 10


<h3>High access rights are set for PowerShell (Fixed)</h3>

For some PCs, for full PowerShell to work, you need to set the permissions at least to the `RemoteSigned` position.
To check your access rights:
  * Call PowerShell Console `Win + R` write `powershell` and `Ok`
  * Enter the command `Get-ExecutionPolicy`
  * If your rights are `Restricted` or `AllSigned` then enter the command 
```ps1
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
````
  
  

<h1>Additional Notes:</h1>

* SpotX will only work correctly on the latest versions of Spotify, please make sure of this before asking a question.  
* The modifiable files are replaced by the Spotify installer every time it is updated, so you will need to apply the patch again when this happens.
* If you notice an error, please leave your comment in the [discussions](https://github.com/amd64fox/SpotX/discussions/new), be sure to attach screenshots.
